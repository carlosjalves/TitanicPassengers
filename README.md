# Titanic Passengers Data Visualization

For this project, we were tasked with developing a visualization model that would simplify the communication of information about a specific concept or idea. Our project demonstrates, in an attractive yet simple way, the relationship between the number of survivors and fatalities in the Titanic shipwreck, organized by class and age group. We represented this using a stacked bar chart, as it proved to be effective for comparison and analysis.

Our objective was to show the relationship between the number of deaths and survivors in each class, organizing the data by age group. These data could be indicative of the social discrimination that existed at the beginning of the 20th century. Another goal was for the visualization to be appealing to the public, capturing their interest rather than repelling it.

With this visualization, the discrimination between social classes during this period in history (early 20th century) became evident. We state this because, based on the visualization derived from the data provided, it is clear that the death toll increased in the graph corresponding to the third class (the least privileged class at that time). In other words, this chart effectively highlights the relationship between the number of survivors and fatalities in each class, organized by age group.
